## Game description
### Goal
Our goal was to implement a neural network to decide if a picture shows a cat or a dog.
We therefore oriented ourselves at Tariq Rashids book "Neuronale Netzwerke selbst implementieren".
Unfortunately, cat and dog images were way to komplex to be handled with our neuronal network.
Therefore we decided to make a neural network to recognice hand written numbers. We implemented a graphical user interface with different nets. Thoses nets do have different performance levels. You can either upload images of handwritten numbers or make them yourself in the GUI. The neural network used test and training data to learn. It will be able to decide which number is shown, even if the conditions are bad.
